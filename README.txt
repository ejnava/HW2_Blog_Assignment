README.txt

This is the readme file for the Ruby on Rails web blog application
for homework 2.  The original application was modified to add the
ability to record and show both the post and commenter's names.  The
implementation also includes verification in the post controller that
restricts the ability to modify posts to a user "admin".

This version does not validate the authors nor does it prevent anyone
from modifying comments.
